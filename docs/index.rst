  You can try powa at demo-powa.anayrat.info_.  Just click "Login" and
  try its features!  Note that in order to get interesting metrics, resources
  have been limited on this server (2 vCPU, 384MB of RAM and 150iops for the
  disks).  Please be patient when using it.

  Thanks to `Adrien Nayrat <https://blog.anayrat.info>`_ for providing it.

PoWA (PostgreSQL Workload Analyzer) is a performance tool for **PostgreSQL 9.4
and newer** allowing to collect, aggregate and purge statistics on multiple
PostgreSQL instances from various :ref:`stat_extensions`.

Depending on your needs, you can either use the provided `background worker`_
(requires a PostgreSQL restart, and more suited for single-instance setups), or
the provided :ref:`powa_collector` daemon (does not require a PostgreSQL
restart, can gather performance metrics from multiple instances, including
standby).

This includes support for various **stat extensions**:

* :ref:`pg_stat_statements_doc`, providing data about queries being executed
* :ref:`pg_qualstats`, providing data about predicates, or where clauses
* :ref:`pg_stat_kcache_doc`, providing data about operating-system level cache
* :ref:`pg_wait_sampling_doc`, providing data about wait events

It supports the following extension:

* :ref:`hypopg_doc`, allowing you to create hypothetical indexes and test their
  usefulness without creating the real index

Additionally, the PoWA User Interface allows you to make the most of this
information.

Main components
***************

* **PoWA-archivist** is the PostgreSQL extension, collecting statistics.
* **PoWA-collector** is the daemon that gather performance metrics from remote
  PostgreSQL instances (optional) on a dedicated repository server.
* **PoWA-web** is the graphical user interface to powa-collected metrics.
* **Stat extensions** are the actual source of data.
* **PoWA** is the whole project.

You should first take a look at the :ref:`quickstart` guide.
