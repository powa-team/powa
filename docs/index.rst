.. note::

  You can try powa at demo-powa.anayrat.info_.  Just click "Login" and
  try its features!  Note that in order to get interesting metrics, resources
  have been limited on this server (2 vCPU, 384MB of RAM and 150iops for the
  disks).  Please be patient when using it.

  Thanks to `Adrien Nayrat <https://blog.anayrat.info>`_ for providing it.

PoWA (PostgreSQL Workload Analyzer) is a performance tool compatible with **all
PostgreSQL versions** (down to 9.4) allowing to collect, aggregate and purge
statistics on multiple PostgreSQL instances from various
:ref:`stat_extensions`.

Depending on your needs, you can choose different approach to setup powa.

For most people, the preferred approach is to use the provided
:ref:`powa_collector` daemon to collect the metrics from one or multiple
**remote** servers, and store them on a single (and usually dedicated)
repository server.  This is called the "remote mode",  It does not require any
PostgreSQL restart, and can gather performance metrics from multiple instances -
including standby server.

The other approach is called the "local mode".  It's a self-contained solution
that relies on a provided and optional `background worker`_, which requires a
PostgreSQL restart to enable it, and more suited for a single-instance setup
only.

In both cases, PoWA will include support for various **stat extensions**:

* :ref:`pg_stat_statements_doc`, providing data about queries being executed
* :ref:`pg_qualstats`, providing data about predicates, or where clauses
* :ref:`pg_stat_kcache_doc`, providing data about operating-system level cache
* :ref:`pg_wait_sampling_doc`, providing data about wait events
* :ref:`pg_track_settings_doc`, providing data about configuration changes and
  server restarts

It also supports the following extension:

* :ref:`hypopg_doc`, allowing you to create hypothetical indexes and test their
  usefulness without creating the real index

Additionally, the PoWA User Interface allows you to make the most of this
information.

Main components
***************

* :ref:`powa_archivist` is the PostgreSQL extension, collecting statistics.
* :ref:`powa_collector` is the daemon that gather performance metrics from remote
  PostgreSQL instances (optional) on a dedicated repository server.
* :ref:`powa_web` is the graphical user interface to powa-collected metrics.
* the :ref:`stat_extensions` are the actual source of data.
* **PoWA** is the whole project.

You should first take a look at the :ref:`quickstart` guide. If you're more interested
in setting up PoWA in remote mode, take a look at the :ref:`debian_remote_quickstart`
guide.
